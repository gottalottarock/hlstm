Model:
    General:
     ✔ add scope property @done (17-12-13 21:16)
    Logging:
     ✔ change properties logic(from tensorflow variables, not from object fields) @done (17-12-13 21:16)
     Notes
     tree_lstm_cell/fully_connected/weights shape
       (embedding lenth + tree_lstm_num_units * 2, tree_lstm_num_units*5) 
     sent_cell/weights shape
       (tree_lstm_num_units * 2 + sent_lstm_num_units, sent_lstm_num_units*4)
     ☐ add logs processing methods
    Save:
     ✔ save only model variables @done (17-12-13 21:16)
    Restore:
     ☐ change restore logic
     ☐ restore without hand-init(cold start restore)
     ☐ get saved model properties
     ☐ understand graphs
     ✔ understand scopes and variable names ending @done (17-12-13 21:18)
    Evaluate:
     ☐ check evaluate
Demo:
   ☐ add HOW TO RESTORE to demo
   ☐ add preprocessing texts demo
   ☐ add HOW TO EVALUATE demo

Design:
  ☐ add ReadMe
  ☐ add pictures or graphs of model topology
  ☐ add results on data
Data:
  ☐ check model on other data
